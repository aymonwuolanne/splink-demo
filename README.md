# Splink demos

This is a collection of demos for the probabilistic linking Python package [Splink](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/splink/index.html). 

I have included some mock datasets to be used for practice, these are `perturbed_data_l.parquet` and `perturbed_data_r.parquet`. These are artificially generated and don't include any real data. The script for generating similar datasets is included here.
